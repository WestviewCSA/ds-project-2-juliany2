After reading the specs, starting populating
a list of things you think you might have to
do to finish this project.

1) read the specs - understand the problem
2) understand map-based input files
3) make test cases
4) reading with map format
5) reading with coordinate format
6) code path finding algorithms with queue, stack, and optimal path finding
7) test with JUnit test cases for errors and fix the bugs
8) figure out how to output the answer in both formats
